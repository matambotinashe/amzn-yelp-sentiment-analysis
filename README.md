# Embedding Model
- In this branch we explore just using a embedding layer onto our model and changing the following hyperparameter amoung other things 
    - embedding dimensions, 
    - maximum length of sequence
    - vocabulary size
    - replacing the flattern layer with the GlobalAveragePooling
